# Project Overview

This is a Udacity front-end web development nanodegree project that uses Jasmine to conduct a series of tests. 


## How to start
Pull this repository <a href="https://github.com/lexizotomayor/Udacity-FEND-Feeder-Testing-Project">Udacity FEND Project 4</a> then find the index.html file and open it in a browser. 


## Instructions

Udacity provided the starter Feed Reader Testing codes. The project seeks to write a series of tests to run against a pre-existing application with Jasmine. 

Based on Udacity's instructions, there are four suites in this project: RSS Feeds, The Menu, Initial Entries and New Feed Selection. These suites ran a series of tests as follows:

1.Tests to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and is not empty.
2.Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a defined URL and that it's not empty.
3.Test that loops through each feed in allFeeds object with a name defined and not empty.
4.Test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default and ensures the menu changes visibility when menu is clicked.
5.Test that ensures when loadFeed function is called and completes the work, there is at least an entry within the feed container. This calls for the use of Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done() function. 
6.Test that ensures after loading a new feed the content changes.
